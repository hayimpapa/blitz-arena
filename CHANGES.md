# ConnectionManager Implementation - Changes Summary

## Files Created

### `blitz-arena-backend/ConnectionManager.js`
- **Purpose**: Reusable connection/networking class for multiplayer games
- **Key Features**:
  - Player session tracking with state management
  - Heartbeat/ping monitoring (5s intervals, 15s timeout detection)
  - Turn timer management with callbacks
  - Rematch timer management with auto-cancel
  - Graceful quit vs unexpected disconnect detection
  - 30-second reconnection window with session restoration
  - Room lifecycle management
  - Comprehensive cleanup for all timers and states

## Files Modified

### `blitz-arena-backend/server.js`
- **What Changed**: Integrated ConnectionManager throughout tic-tac-toe game logic
- **Specific Changes**:
  1. Removed local Maps: `playerSessions`, `rematchTimeouts`, `turnTimers`
  2. Added ConnectionManager instantiation at startup
  3. Updated `authenticate` handler to support reconnection
  4. Replaced all `clearTurnTimer()` calls with `connectionManager.clearTurnTimer()`
  5. Replaced all `startTurnTimer()` implementation with ConnectionManager delegation
  6. Updated rematch timeout logic to use `connectionManager.startRematchTimer()`
  7. Added `connectionManager.joinRoom()` calls in `createGameRoom()`
  8. Integrated `connectionManager.handleDisconnect()` in disconnect handler
  9. Added `connectionManager.cleanupRoom()` calls when rooms are deleted
  10. Simplified disconnect handling - ConnectionManager tracks state

## Why These Changes

**Before**: Timer management, player tracking, and reconnection logic scattered across server.js in ad-hoc Maps and functions

**After**: All networking concerns centralized in reusable, well-documented ConnectionManager class

**Benefits**:
1. **Reusability**: Can add new games without reimplementing connection logic
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for all networking state
3. **Reconnection**: Built-in 30s reconnection window (previously not supported)
4. **Heartbeat**: Active connection monitoring prevents ghost connections
5. **Cleanup**: Comprehensive timer/state cleanup prevents memory leaks
6. **Separation**: Game logic (server.js) separated from connection logic (ConnectionManager)
